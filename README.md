# Community-Fantasy-Animals
Organizing a hopefully-public project to give life to vanilla-style Rimworld fantasy animals.

The plan is:

1. Artists will upload art as it is created.
2. A modder will create basic code to get the animal functional and moving. This will be incorporated into the main mod.
3. All animals are up for grabs for other modders to make their own mods, expanding on any animal's capabilities.
4. What happens if everybody loves a particular fancy variation on an animal?  Should it be incorporated into the main mod, or is there a way to point to it, or should there be a secondary mod that compiles the "Greatest Hits"?
