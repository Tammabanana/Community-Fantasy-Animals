Draconic Things

Bone Dragon - The corpse of a dragon that refused to accept it's end. Although it is more passive in it's undead form, the bone dragon is immensely strong when attacked.
(I tried to make desiccated dragon corpses, ended up with a creature first. ~Grey)

Behir - A serpentine dragon with many legs, known for it's sparkling hide and quick, stunning attacks.
(Fancy fancy, not a huge-sized monster though. Bigger than a dog, smaller than a dragon? ~ Grey)

Basilisk - A heavyset crocodilian behemoth that has a petrifying glare more fierce than it's mighty bite. With six strong legs it can lunge forward at great speeds when necessary, although it rarely needs to chase down it's prey.
(Big in size, not sure if we'll be able to add in a petrify-type ability but that would be pretty awesome. ~Grey)

Basilisk (Alt)
(I thought the original was a bit dark, and prefer this version. Keeping the other available though, in case anyone wants a stronger variant or something? ~Grey)

Ice Dragon - A smaller, rounded dragon adapted to cold climates. Their hide is valuable both for it's insulation quality, and the slight shimmer that is reminiscent of ice crystals.
(First attempt at a recolour of existing art, trying out a slightly thicker outer line as well.~Grey)
