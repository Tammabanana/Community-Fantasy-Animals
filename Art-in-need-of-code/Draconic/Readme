Draconic Things

Bone Dragon - The corpse of a dragon that refused to accept it's end. Although it is more passive in it's undead form, the bone dragon is immensely strong when attacked.
(I tried to make desiccated dragon corpses, ended up with a creature first. ~Grey)

Behir - A serpentine dragon with many legs, known for it's sparkling hide and quick, stunning attacks.
(Fancy fancy, not a huge-sized monster though. Bigger than a dog, smaller than a dragon? ~ Grey)
